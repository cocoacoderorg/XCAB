This is a set of (at least at the moment) shell scripts that manage a process whereby code can be modified from and uploaded to [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), at which point a Mac running these scripts will notice the Dropox changes, check those changes into git, build a new iOS executable from the git changes, push that executable to a web page, and send the user a push notification to come get it.

There's a [video demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ9ctI8UBLA) up on YouTube, a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/carlbrown/developing-ios-apps-on-your-ipad-with-xcab) on SlideShare that I gave last Thursday to the Austin [CocoaCoder](http://www.cocoacoder.org/CocoaCoder.org/Hello.html) group, if you want more information.

It's MIT licensed, so feel free to try it out and send me feedback or updates via fork requests.  I find it useful, and I hope other people will, too.

I'm currently using BetaBuilder to generate the ipa file, and using the [Boxcar](http://boxcar.io/) API to send push notifications.

You'll need to get [the command line version of BetaBuilder](git://github.com/sgruby/iOS-BetaBuilder.git), at least at the moment.

I've done some cleanup so it should be conceivable that it should work on someone else's machine (although, as far as I know, so far it never has).

I think what I've decided to do long term is to make a Mac MenuBar (NSStatusItem) based App and use NSTimer instead of running it from cron, and then work on moving a piece of it at a time from bash to Cocoa.  Then I'll make an iOS app to simplify what you have to do on the iOS side.
